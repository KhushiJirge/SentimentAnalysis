text = "Late at night, Lisa awoke to the sound of soft footsteps echoing through the dark house. She checked the hallway, but it was empty. Shrugging it off, she returned to bed, only to catch a glimpse of herself in the full-length mirror across the room.

As her heart raced, the reflection lifted a finger to its lips, whispering, Don't wake up."
